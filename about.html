                    <p>Our helmets are made up of 100% pure PolyCarbonate, which is one of the strongest plastic materials on the market, even being able to withstand the direct impact of a shotgun bullet without even cracking. To make your needs easier, the astroXpress helmet includes ports for both food and water, making it easy and accessible to remain nourished during our flight. The visor functions as round pair of sunglasses, protecting you from both sun rays and radiation.</p>
