                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>astroXpress is a newly established brand. We are striving for the top position regarding tourism in space, by doing everything we can to make sure every person is going to get to experience space in the near future. We aim to provide the cheapest and most accessible flight for our passengers without compromising security, even going to extreme lengths to proof both our space shuttles, our seating and ordering custom made, specially designed spacesuits.</p>

                <h2>The tip</h2>
                <p>The astroXpress shuttle goes from ground to orbit in around 8.5 minutes. However we will keep you up there for longer. This speed is all thanks to the tip of the shuttle, which has been carefully calculated and calibrated to penetrate the atmosphere with ease. The booster separation, happens at about t-plus 126 seconds. The separable boosters all contain both parachutes and oms-reverse rockets to make sure they land in the ocean and is ready for re-use for the next flight.</p>

                <h2>Seating</h2>
                <p>The space shuttle itself can only contain 7 astronauts at once and it requires two of our own experts to handle the shuttle during flight. To protect the passengers from the incoming heat from both the engines and the sun, our shuttle is covered in 30.000 thermal protection tiles, which are thoroughly inspected and replaced before and after every takeoff. These tiles are made of a special material, making them able to cool down in mere minutes after absorbing heat.</p>

                <h2>The engine</h2>
                <p>The astroXpress shuttle engines are revolutionary, traveling at a stunning speed of 17.500 miles per. hr. (28.000 km per. hr.). At this speed, you will be able to see a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes. To make this possible, we have created our very own patterned chemical fuel composition, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen and a very special compound called quercetin. This enables our shuttles to take off and land with more elegance, making it a more comfortable ride for the passengers.</p>

                <h2>Where are we?</h2>
                <p>The astroXpress team operates out of our offices located in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Our main headquarters are located in the danish coast-town Esbjerg, where we mainly operate from. As of now, we have three launch areas located in Scandinavia. We have made sure to position our launch areas in the water to both make sure we don’t disturb the public, and to make sure our separatable boosters always fall in the ocean. We plan to expand to the UK and the US soon.</p>

                <h2>The helmet</h2>
                <p>Our helmets are made up of 100% pure PolyCarbonate, which is one of the strongest plastic materials on the market, even being able to withstand the direct impact of a shotgun bullet without even cracking. To make your needs easier, the astroXpress helmet includes ports for both food and water, making it easy and accessible to remain nourished during our flight. The visor functions as round pair of sunglasses, protecting you from both sun rays and radiation.</p>

                <h2>The Suit</h2>
                <p>astroXpress offers different sizes in our space suits. We have gotten 20 different suits made so we’ll make sure to find one that fits each and every person perfectly. We have put a lot of focus and attention into the suit’s gloves. We have added a padding of silicone rubber to the fingertips, making the wearer able to maintain the sense of touch while moving in our shuttle. Included in the suit is built-in bags for storing water and, if needed, your sanitorial needs.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>At astroXpress we value safety very highly and this is seen in our specially-designed space suits. The material of the suits is built up in layers. The middle layer in the suit is pressurized to fit the wearer’s body, cooling it down and preventing the wearer from overheating. The outer layer of the spacesuit is made of our own patterned chemical composition, making the suit entirely puncture proof if the seat belt digs a bit too roughly into the spacesuit’s outer exterior.</p>
