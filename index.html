                <p>Our helmets are made up of 100% pure PolyCarbonate, which is one of the strongest plastic materials on the market, even being able to withstand the direct impact of a shotgun bullet without even cracking. To make your needs easier, the astroXpress helmet includes ports for both food and water, making it easy and accessible to remain nourished during our flight. The visor functions as round pair of sunglasses, protecting you from both sun rays and radiation.</p>

                <p>The astroXpress shuttle engines are revolutionary, traveling at a stunning speed of 17.500 miles per. hr. (28.000 km/h). At this speed, you will be able to see a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes. To make this possible, we have created our very own patterned chemical fuel composition, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen and a very special compound called quercetin. This enables our shuttles to take off and land with more elegance, making it a more comfortable ride for the passengers.</p>
